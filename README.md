# Project-19---Turtle-Race

This project was built as part of my 100 Days of Code journey to practice Python fundamentals through interactive and visual programs.

The Turtle Race game allows users to place a bet and watch multiple turtles race across the screen at random speeds.

**Project Overview**

The Turtle Race project:

Creates multiple turtle racers

Allows the user to bet on a turtle color

Moves each turtle forward by random distances

Determines a winner when a turtle crosses the finish line

Displays the race outcome based on the user’s bet

Each race produces a different outcome due to randomness.

**Why this project exists**

This project was designed to reinforce:

Object creation and management

User input handling

Loops and condition-based logic

Randomized behavior

Simple game mechanics using Python graphics

It bridges basic Python logic with interactive visual output.

**What I learned**

How to create and control multiple Turtle objects

How to group objects using lists

How to manage game state using boolean flags

How randomness affects game outcomes

How to handle user input through graphical prompts

How to detect positions using Turtle coordinates

**How the code works (step-by-step)**

Set up the Turtle graphics screen.

Prompt the user to place a bet on a turtle color.

Create multiple turtle racers with different colors.

Position turtles vertically to form racing lanes.

Start the race loop if the user places a bet.

Move each turtle forward by a random distance every cycle.

Detect when a turtle crosses the finish line.

Compare the winning turtle to the user’s bet and display the result.


**Example Output**

A race where colorful turtle icons move across the screen at varying speeds,

ending when one turtle crosses the finish line,

followed by a win or loss message based on the user’s bet.

**This project demonstrates:**

Interactive programming

Visual feedback using Turtle graphics

Basic game logic and randomness

Clean separation of setup, gameplay, and result logic
